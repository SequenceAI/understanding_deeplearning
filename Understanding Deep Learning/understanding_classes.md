```python
import numpy as np

class DenseLayer:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        # Initialize weights and biases
        self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size)
        self.biases = np.zeros((1, output_size))

    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Perform the forward pass (linear transformation)
        self.inputs = inputs
        self.output = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases

    def backward(self, dvalues, learning_rate=0.001):

        self.dweights = np.dot(self.inputs.T, dvalues)
        self.dbiases = np.sum(dvalues, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        # Gradient on input values
        self.dinputs = np.dot(dvalues, self.weights.T)
        
        # Update parameters
        self.weights -= learning_rate * self.dweights
        self.biases -= learning_rate * self.dbiases

# Example usage
# Suppose we have 3 input features and 2 output neurons
dense = DenseLayer(input_size=3, output_size=2)

# Forward pass with some example input
inputs = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])
dense.forward(inputs)
print("Output of the dense layer (forward pass):")
print(dense.output)

# Backward pass with some example gradients (from the next layer in a network)
gradients = np.array([[1, 0.5]])
dense.backward(gradients)
print("\nGradients on weights after backward pass:")
print(dense.dweights)
print("\nGradients on biases after backward pass:")
print(dense.dbiases)

Let's break down the code line by line and address your question about subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

```python
import numpy as np
```

This line imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations, particularly for working with arrays and matrices.

```python
class DenseLayer:
class DenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
```

- `class DenseLayer:` defines a new class named `DenseLayer`. In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). Everything within this class will define the attributes and behaviors (methods) that objects of this class will have.
- If you want to build on an existing class, you can inherit from it. For example, you can create a dense layer class that inherits from TensorFlow’s base layer class:

Here, `DenseLayer` is inheriting from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. This means that `DenseLayer` will have all the methods and properties of a TensorFlow layer, plus anything additional you define within it. This allows you to create custom layers while leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functionality.

### Inside the Class

```python
def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
```

- `def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):` is the constructor method. It's a special method that is automatically called when you create an instance of the class.
- `self` refers to the instance of the class itself. `input_size` and `output_size` are parameters that you pass when you create a `DenseLayer` object, which specify the number of input and output units for the dense layer.

```python
    self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size)
    self.biases = np.zeros((1, output_size))
```

- `self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size)` initializes the weights for the layer using a random normal distribution. `self.weights` is now an attribute of the `DenseLayer` instance.
- `self.biases = np.zeros((1, output_size))` initializes the biases for the layer to zeros. Biases are added to the output to help the model fit the data better

### Forward Pass

```python
    def forward(self, inputs):
        self.inputs = inputs
        self.output = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
```

- `def forward(self, inputs):` defines a method named `forward` that will perform the forward pass of the neural network layer.
- `self.inputs = inputs` stores the inputs to the layer, which are used later during the backward pass for gradient calculations.
- `self.output = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases` computes the output of the layer. It multiplies the inputs by the weights and adds the biases (this is the core operation of a dense layer).

### Backward Pass (for Training)

```python
    def backward(self, dvalues, learning_rate=0.001):
        self.dweights = np.dot(self.inputs.T, dvalues)
        self.dbiases = np.sum(dvalues, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        self.dinputs = np.dot(dvalues, self.weights.T)
        
        self.weights -= learning_rate * self.dweights
        self.biases -= learning_rate * self.dbiases
```

### Subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer`

If you subclass `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, you can leverage TensorFlow's built-in functionalities like automatic differentiation, easier model saving/loading, and integration with the rest of the Keras API. Here’s how you might implement it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_size):
        super(DenseLayer, self).__init__()
        self.output_size = output_size

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.weights = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.output_size),
                                       initializer='random_normal',
                                       trainable=True)
        self.biases = self.add_weight(shape=(self.output_size,),
                                      initializer='zeros',
                                      trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
```

- `super(DenseLayer, self).__init__()` calls the constructor of the parent class (`tf.keras.layers.Layer`), ensuring that the layer is properly initialized.
- `self.add_weight()` is a TensorFlow utility that adds a weight variable to the layer, handling initialization and tracking automatically.
- `call(self, inputs)` is where the forward computation is defined, similar to the `forward()` method in our manual implementation.

This makes the layer fully compatible with TensorFlow's ecosystem, allowing it to be used in `tf.keras.Sequential` models, support for automatic differentiation, and much more.
