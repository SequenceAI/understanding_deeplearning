# Deep Learning, Transformers & TensorFlow

**Deep Learning:**

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It has gained significant attention and popularity due to its ability to automatically learn representations from data. Here are some key concepts to get you started:

1. **Neural Networks:**
    - The basic building block of deep learning is the artificial neural network, which is inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.
    - Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where each connection has a weight associated with it.
    - The input layer receives data, and the output layer produces the desired output. Intermediate layers are called hidden layers.
2. **Activation Functions:**
    - Activation functions introduce non-linearities to the network, allowing it to learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs.
    - Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Tanh.
3. **Training:**
    - Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual output (loss).
    - Backpropagation is a common algorithm for optimizing the weights by minimizing the loss.
4. **Deep Learning Libraries:**
    - TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular open-source deep learning libraries. They provide high-level abstractions for building and training neural networks.

**TensorFlow:**

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by the Google Brain team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Installation:**
    - You can install TensorFlow using pip:
        
        ```
        pip install tensorflow
        
        ```
        
2. **TensorFlow Basics:**
    - TensorFlow uses a dataflow graph to represent computations. Nodes in the graph represent operations, and edges represent data flow.
    - You define and run computations in TensorFlow using tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays.
3. **Keras API:**
    - TensorFlow 2.x integrates the Keras API, a high-level neural networks API that simplifies the process of building and training models.
